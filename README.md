# Katas

## Introduction

Katas are short programming exercises that presents you all kind of different problems so as they could be done daily. The repetition and the diversity of these challenges could help you to solve problems faster and strengthen the logic skills. There are multiple platforms that offer these kind of exercises but every of them structures their content in a different way. The results are stored in each of them.

The purpouse of this repository is to gather all the solutions of katas that I´ve done and explain each of them. I found that it is important to review every step of the solution, so as I could follow the reasoning easily and the knowledge couldn´t be missed. It is a tool for me to consolidate the learning process while I continue practising.

## Example

### Folder Structure

There is a folder for every platform and difficulty level, besides a common folder that contains all the solutions of the platform too. As it could be seen as redundant, I do this to help me to manage the access of the solutions in two different ways. Also, this could help me to find an specific kata or compare similar ones quicker.

**Example**: 

```sh
├── README.md
├── codesignal
│   ├── arcade
│   └── interview
├── codewars
│   ├── 5-kyu
│   │   └── 5kyu_moving-zeroes-to-the-end.md
│   ├── 6-kyu
│   │   └── 6kyu_playing-with-digits.md
│   ├── 7-kyu
│   │   └── 7kyu_friend-or-foe.md
│   └── 8-kyu
│       └── 8kyu_even-or-odd.md
├── hackerRank

```

Additionally, there is a folder that contains some resources that helps me to mantain the workflow and readability of the repo.

### Updates

At the moment, I find this method as a practical way to store files from different platforms while I continue my learning process. In the future, I am planning to update this repository with a web scrapper to collect every problem that I solve in a more efficient way while ensuring easier scalability.

- *This respository it is not encouraging to cheat by any means.*
- It is strongly recommended to solve the problems by themselves before consulting other solutions as it it said in every similar website.
